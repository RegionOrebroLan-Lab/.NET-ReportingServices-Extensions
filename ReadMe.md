# .NET-ReportingServices-Extensions

Extensions/additions for SQL Server Reporting Services.

For the moment two versions: 14, 15
Make a release for 14 and then set 15 to main-branch

## Important
Remember the **Federation-cookies** branch when you move this repository. First checkin the **Federation-cookies** branch in the new repository and branch it to **Federation-cookies** branch in the new repository. Then checkin this master-branch to the master-branch in the new repository. Just so you save the code you have so far with decrypt/encrypt FedAuth cookie (that does not work).
