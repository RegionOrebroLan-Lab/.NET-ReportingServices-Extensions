# .NET-ReportingServices-Extensions

# IMPORTANT!

Support for **Microsoft SQL Server 2016 Reporting Services** does not work yet, see: [Version 13 for Reporting Services 2016 does not work](https://github.com/RegionOrebroLan-Lab/.NET-ReportingServices-Extensions/issues/1/)

Also - when this solution is considered stable this repository will move to https://github.com/RegionOrebroLan/.

=======================================
=======================================

Extensions/additions for SQL Server Reporting Services.

For the moment three versions: 13, 14, 15
Make a release for, 13, then 14, and then set 15 to main-branch

## Important
Remember the **Federation-cookies** branch when you move this repository. First checkin the **Federation-cookies** branch in the new repository and branch it to **Federation-cookies** branch in the new repository. Then checkin this master-branch to the master-branch in the new repository. Just so you save the code you have so far with decrypt/encrypt FedAuth cookie (that does not work).
