## Important
Remember the **Federation-cookies** branch when you move this repository. First checkin the **Federation-cookies** branch in the new repository and branch it to **Federation-cookies** branch in the new repository. Then checkin this master-branch to the master-branch in the new repository. Just so you save the code you have so far with decrypt/encrypt FedAuth cookie (that does not work).
